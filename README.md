# Starter API

## Overview

This project is an ASP.NET Core Web API that implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system. It provides a secure, scalable, and maintainable foundation for building enterprise-level APIs.

## Features

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system.
- **Authorization**: Custom role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- **User Management**: CRUD operations for user accounts.
- **Role Management**: Create roles and assign permissions.
- **API Versioning**: Support for multiple API versions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage.
- **Logging**: Advanced structured logging using Serilog.
- **Database**: Entity Framework Core with SQL Server.
- **Swagger Documentation**: API documentation and testing interface.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 7.0 SDK or later
- SQL Server
- (Optional) Redis for distributed caching

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starterapi.git
   cd starterapi
   ```

2. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your SQL Server instance.

3. Apply database migrations:
   ```
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Access Swagger UI at `https://localhost:5001/swagger` (the port might be different on your machine).

## Project Structure

- `Controllers/`: API endpoints
- `Models/`: Data models and DTOs
- `Services/`: Business logic and data access
- `Middleware/`: Custom middleware components
- `Migrations/`: Database migrations

## Key Components

### Authentication

JWT-based authentication is implemented. Users can obtain a token by sending their credentials to the `/api/Auth/login` endpoint.

### Authorization

Custom RBAC is implemented using policy-based authorization. Permissions are defined at the action level using the `[Permission]` attribute.

### Rate Limiting

Basic rate limiting is implemented using ASP.NET Core's built-in rate limiting middleware. It's configured in `Program.cs`.

### Logging

Serilog is used for structured logging. Logs are written to both console and file. The `RequestLoggingMiddleware` logs details of each HTTP request.

## Configuration

Key configuration options are available in `appsettings.json`:

- `ConnectionStrings`: Database connection string
- `JwtSettings`: JWT token configuration
- `Serilog`: Logging configuration
- `ClientRateLimiting`: Rate limiting rules

## API Versioning

The API supports versioning. Different versions of the API can be accessed by including the version in the URL, e.g., `/api/v1/users` or `/api/v2/users`.

Based on the Swagger documentation you've provided, you have indeed implemented the core functionality for user and role management. Let's break down what you can do and identify any potential gaps:

1. Create and manage users:
   - Create user: POST /api/v1/User
   - Get all users: GET /api/v1/User
   - Get user by ID: GET /api/v1/User/{id}
   - Update user: PUT /api/v1/User/{id}
   - Deactivate user: PATCH /api/v1/User/{id}/deactivate

2. Login:
   - Login: POST /api/Auth/login

3. Create and manage roles:
   - Create role: POST /api/RoleManagement/CreateRole
   - Get all roles: GET /api/RoleManagement/GetRoles
   - Get role by ID: GET /api/RoleManagement/GetRole/{roleId}

4. Add users to the role:
   - Assign role to user: POST /api/RoleManagement/AssignRoleToUser
   - Remove role from user: DELETE /api/RoleManagement/RemoveRoleFromUser

5. Edit permissions under each role:
   - Assign permission to role: POST /api/RoleManagement/AssignPermissionToRole
   - Remove permission from role: DELETE /api/RoleManagement/RemovePermissionFromRole

6. Get user profile:
   - Get user profile: GET /api/Profile

Additional functionality available:
   - Weather Forecast: GET /WeatherForecast (This seems to be a sample endpoint and may not be relevant to your core functionality)

What you've implemented covers the basic requirements for user and role management with permissions. However, there are a few things that might be missing or could be improved:

1. Password reset functionality: There's no endpoint for users to reset their passwords.
2. Email verification: If you want to verify user emails, you might need additional endpoints.
3. Refresh token: There's no endpoint to refresh the JWT token, which is useful for maintaining user sessions.
4. User search or filtering: The current GET /api/v1/User endpoint doesn't seem to have parameters for searching or filtering users.
5. Pagination: For endpoints that return lists (like users or roles), you might want to add pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.
6. User self-registration: While you can create users, there's no specific endpoint for user self-registration (which might have different logic than admin user creation).
7. Multi-factor authentication: If you want to add an extra layer of security, you might consider implementing MFA.
8. Account lockout: Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.
9. Audit logging: Add endpoints to view logs of user activities and system changes.
10. Health checks: While you mentioned implementing health checks, I don't see an endpoint for it in the Swagger documentation. You might want to add /health endpoints.

Remember, the necessity of these additional features depends on your specific requirements and use cases. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for basic user and role management with permissions.
